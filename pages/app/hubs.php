                    <p>Don’t let Brighton’s traditional British seaside reputation fool you – it’s one of the UK’s top centres for game creation, and a magnet for talent. Brighton is just another example of how key gaming hubs can operate outside capital cities. With nearly 100 studios, it is a well-established, well connected hub, that offers not only fantastic employment opportunities, but also a close-knit gaming network and a fantastic quality of living.</p>
