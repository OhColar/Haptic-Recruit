                                <p>In my 7 years in the gaming industry, Haptic Recruit has easily been the best recruiter I have worked with. From understanding what I wanted/needed in my search for my next role, to preppingme for the interviews - with meticulous detail. All I can say is; listen to them, take their advice, and watch them work their magic.</p>

                                <p>We decided to work with Hannah @ Haptic Recruit because we knew of some of her previous hires in the space and were impressed. We have been very happy with the process, CV selection and candidate vetting by Hannah and James. We only met with high quality candidates and subsequently offered 2 roles which were quickly accepted. Would use again for future roles and highly recommend to other start ups looking to grow their team with the right skill and culture fit.</p>

                                <p>Haptic Recruit really felt refreshing from other recruiters; they spent a lot of time making sure the process was always moving forwards and I truly felt I wasn’t just the first result out of a quick search. They clearly spent time researching me and making sure I was a good fit for the role they were recruiting for. Absolutely cannot say enough good things about Haptic Recruit, and I would not hesitate in recommending them to act for you.</p>
